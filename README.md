## What is PanfuJs

PanfuJs was/is my attempt to recreate the old flash client in pure html5 and js.
This is to start my own panfu website just for fun and nostalgia.

Why a rewrite?!

You may contribute if you want. i want this client to be open source for the community.

### Contact

Be sure to contact me if you still have the full flash client, I'd love to add more stuff in to this.
