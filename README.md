# What is PanfuJs

PanfuJs was/is my attempt to recreate the old flash client in pure html5 and js.
This is to start my own panfu website just for fun and nostalgia.

###Why a rewrite?!

When i was playing on a private server years ago and heard about flash being deprecated by 2021 i was like why not recreate this as a project for school.
I got far and actually made something that worked in js and canvas but my knowledge was really limited.
It was really messy and a few years later i decided to rewrite it with an engine kind of approach so that implementing stuff would be better.
After looking at many options i decided to go for pixiJS as renderer and here we are.

And let's be real here.. flash emulators or older chromium containers aren't really a solution but just a patch for a problem that should be solved.

### why not unity or unreal godot or anything else?!
Because it's fun and i think AAA engines are way to heavy for a game like this.
It's like putting a race engine in to a small car. will it work?! probably... is it resource hungry and impractical hell yea.


## can i contribute?! FUCK YES!
You may contribute if you want. i want this client to be open source for the community.

### Contact

Be sure to contact me if you still have the full flash client, I'd love to add more stuff in to this.
